<h1>Project 4: Experimentation</h1>

Due 11:59pm, Friday, May 4 through GitHub

<b>No late assignments will be accepted</b>

This project is entirely extra credit. 

The intention of this project is to walk you through the phases of a visualization experiment. Each phase is worth 10 extra credit points on your project grade, for a total of 40 possible points.  

<h2>Collaboration Policy:</h2>
As this is an extra credit project, I ask that you complete the project individually. Duplicate projects will receive no credit.

You are welcome to use resources found online; however, the code you submit should be your own (please do not directly copy-paste code from a tutorial or online example). If you use code from any online sources, please also list those sources and what pieces of the code you used those sources to complete. Also, for each of these sources, please add your own comments as to what the code does so I can grade your project based on your own understanding of the code. 

<h2>Submission: </h2>
All assignments must be submitted through GitHub. Written questions should be submitted as a PDF with your name located at the top of the document. Any code or images of experimental stimuli should be in a "Apparatus" directory and any data and analysis should be in a "Data" directory.

<h2>Project Specifications</h2>

<h3>Part 1: Designing an Experiment</h3>
Write an experiment to test a specific question about an aspect of the effectiveness of visualizations. Note that this experiment should address a specific question that you can answer by measuring people's performance in a certain task. 

In your writeup, include a concise but thorough description of the following aspects of the experiment: 
* Research Question (What question will you address?)
* Hypotheses (What do you think will happen and why?)
* Independent Variables (What will you change? What are the levels of each?)
* Dependent Variables/Measures (What will you measure?)
* Control Variables (What else do you need to account for? How will you do it?)
* Description of the Stimuli (What will the participant see? Can be an annotated sketch or a verbal description. Include the source of any data needed)
* Experimental Procedure (What will the participant do? Please describe this using a step-by-step procedure and include any details necessary to conduct the experiment)
* Planned Analysis (How will you analyze your dependent variables and why?)

Please be as clear and specific as possible.

<h3>Part 2: Building the Apparatus</h3>
Construct the apparatus you need to conduct this experiment. This can be a program (e.g., a web site or python program) or the full set of questions and stimuli you'd use to test your hypotheses. If you choose to provide the stimuli and questionnaires rather than a program, note in your document how those pieces would fit together. 

<h3>Part 3: Conducting the Study</h3>
Use your apparatus to collect data from at least 5 different people. In your document, provide a visualization of the resulting data that helps answer your research question and briefly describe what you find.

<h3>Part 4: Inferential Analysis</h3>
Use either inferential or bayesian methods to analyze the outcomes of your experiment in accordance with your planned analysis in part 1. In your document, describe what you found and what it tells you about your research question.
